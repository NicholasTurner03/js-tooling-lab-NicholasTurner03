## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 5-10

## Self-Reflection:

This assignment was hard for me. I followed the directions exactly and the tests files that were supposed to download never did, so I had to do things manually and because of that I don't think some of the testing worked. I followed all the directions correctly until I got to the cypress section, which I kind of got lost at and was only able to do some of.

### How long it took me to finish this?

A very long time, probably more than 4 hours, maybe 5.
